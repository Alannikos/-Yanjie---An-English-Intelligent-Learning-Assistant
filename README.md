**Project Name:** YanJie - Intelligent English Learning Assistant

**Project Overview:** YanJie is a comprehensive intelligent English learning assistant designed to provide an immersive English learning experience through features like situational dialogues, mock exams, AI reading companion, AI writing companion, and AI translation. The project will be implemented based on tools such as **Xtuner** and **LMDeploy** from the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, combined with **TTS** and **ASR** technologies, and using the **InternLM2** series models.

**ðŸ”¥ Project Goals:**

1. Provide situational dialogues and topic discussions to enhance users' speaking skills.
2. Help users assess and improve their English proficiency through mock exams.
3. Offer personalized reading and writing companion services using AI technology.
4. Implement AI translation to facilitate cross-language communication.

**ðŸŒŸ Main Features:**

1. **Regular Dialogue:** Support for everyday voice conversations.
2. **Situational Dialogue:** Use images to guide the model in related thematic dialogues, simulating real-life scenarios.
3. **Topic Discussion:** Trigger related topics based on keywords to promote in-depth discussions.
4. **Video Call:** Combine digital human technology to provide a more natural communication experience.
